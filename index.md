# Starter Style Guide

## Purpose

We want anyone using our products to find what they're looking for and get things done as simply and quickly as possible. So we've put together all our best practices, tools and guidelines into one handy style guide.

It determines how our designs look, such as the colour, typography and imagery they use.

It is intended to be used as a starting point for the development of a brand identity or design system. It is a 'working document'

## Principles

A set of principles underpins all our design decisions and guides us when we need to make hard choices. This set is a criteria for what makes good design and all design patterns are evaluated against it.

### Simple

We achieve simplicity by prioritising direction over choice. Offer one thought-out optimal path to the member. In most situations, there is a best path, choice or solution. Do research and find out what it is. Do the hard work, so that our members don’t have to.

Examples:
- one prominent call to action per screen. For example, in the move out process, it might have been useful to have multiple calls to action but we chose to display the most important one
- one email one message
- one question at a time in the Join journey, binary questions rather than multiple options
- simple, concise and straightforward tone of voice

### Robust

Like a good children’s toy, Bulb should be built for exploration. Anyone should be able to understand how it works without an instruction. You just try it out and see what happens. It’s easy to undo and impossible to break. And when we say ‘anyone’ we mean it. The products and services we create should be accessible for all people, regardless of their mental or physical abilities.

Examples:
- labels are specific to actions, so that they don’t need additional instructions
- chunky buttons and controls, large type, bold but simple colour choices, thick outlines, not bitty, components don’t break at different screen sizes
- robust reusable code

### Personal

Don't be afraid to have fun and experiment. But while you have a license to be silly, empathy for our members is everything. Let our personality show, but be serious when you need to be. Examples: Illustrations with humour, bold simple colours (one tone, flat, no gradients).

- using playful metaphors, such as animals in the annual energy report
- using fun names in code, such as animal names in the typescale
- personalizing Ui copy to member's specific circumstances
- positive and friendly tone of voice

Always provide sufficient colour contrast with background: minimum 3.0  [colour ratio](http://contrast-ratio.com/).
